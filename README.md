## Project Summary
This project leverages the Sakila database to analyze movie rentals, customer behavior, and business performance. The analysis includes data extraction using SQL, entity-relationship diagram (ERD) creation, and visualization using Excel. Key insights include the most popular movies, top genres by revenue, rental rates by category, and average film length by category. The results inform strategic decisions in inventory management, marketing, and financial planning.
